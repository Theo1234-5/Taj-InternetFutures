## Homework Assignment

### Overview
In this assignment, you will apply accessibility principles to bring into your web application that can be fully navigated and used without a mouse. Remember that design decisions embed social values and whose interests technology serves.


## Assignment Brief

Apply at least 2 of the examples seen in class that demonstrates comprehensive accessibility features. Your application should have well elaborated and fully functional accesibility elements. 

### Examples of features to apply in your website

#### 1. Navigation system 
- Implement a "Skip to main content" link
- Create a navigation menu with at least 4 links
- Ensure all links have clear focus indicators
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (document them clearly)

#### 2. Interactive form 
- Include at least 5 form fields (text inputs, select menus, checkboxes, radio buttons)
- Properly associate labels with form inputs
- Implement clear error messages and validation feedback
- Ensure all form controls are keyboard accessible
- Add ARIA attributes for required fields and error states

#### 3. Modal dialog or dropdown 
- Create a modal dialog or dropdown menu
- Implement focus trapping (focus stays within modal when open)
- Allow closing with Escape key
- Return focus to trigger element when closed
- Use appropriate ARIA roles and attributes

#### 4. Dynamic content updates 
- Implement at least one section with dynamically updating content
- Use ARIA live regions to announce updates to screen readers
- Ensure status messages are accessible
- Consider loading states and error messages

#### 5. Visual design 
- Make sure that sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Design clear focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information


### Testing
Test your application using:
- Keyboard only navigation (unplug your mouse!)
- Browser developer tools accessibility checker
- At least one screen reader (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac, ORCA on Linux)?

Document your testing process and any issues you discovered.
