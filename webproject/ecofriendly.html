        <p>An eco-friendly lifestyle is 
            important for various reasons, from reduced carbon footprint and energy consumption to even personal 
            and social benefits such as improved health. In Holborn and St Pancras, 22% of climate emissions are from 
            homes. 40% of homes are rated EPC D or below, meaning they are notably bad at insulating heat. That's 
            18,241 households with unnecessarily high energy bills, and according to government data, at least 9% of 
            households are in feul poverty. Improved insulation will reduce energy bills and carbon emissions as well 
            as improved social health leading to lower costs for NHS. Additionally, 100% of neighbourhoods in Holborn 
            and St Pancras have air pollution above levels reccomended by the World Health Organization, and 5% of the 
            population suffers from respiratory diseases which are made worse by air polution. As the demand for 
            eco-friendliness increases, we speculate buildings of the Holborn area to undergo 
            modifications to adapt to the necessary conditions of the environment. In order to acheive this, we
            speculate Holborn to take similar approaches to the impressive design "Earth-tect".

            “Earth-tect” detached house is designed to achieve net zero CO2 emissions over its full 60-year lifecycle. 
            It combines thermal insulation, solar power, storage batteries, and a renewable energy supply at no extra 
            cost. It’s the first of its kind among major Japanese home builders to offer a fully decarbonised housing 
            option from construction to demolition. In Japan, concerns over energy costs, natural disasters, and 
            sustainability are causing demand for resilient and eco-friendly housing, and government policies are 
            shifting towards stricter standards like net-zero homes. Consumers who value long-term savings, 
            sustainability and durability (such as younger, environmentally conscious buyers and those in places where 
            energy costs or climate extremes matter) are most likely affected. For the brand, it boosts leadership in 
            decarbonisation and helps stand out in a changing market. The start of “earth-tect” shows a general 
            direction towards lifecycle decarbonisation on housing as well as operational energy savings. Consumers 
            want digital methods to track CO2  emissions and energy usage in real time. This is encouraging brands to 
            explore eco-monitoring apps and carbon-accounting services. With increasing climate risks, homes may also 
            taken on adaptive features for heatwaves, floods, or power outages.
