      <p><b>The future of holborn holds many great things, some of which will be predicted in this website. The key topics we think will be affected are public transport, waste disposal, environmental efforts, and supporting a more healthy lifestyle.</b></p>
      <p>In this website we will provide information and reasoning behind why we think these will take place in this area. All of the changes made will come from the perspective of a local government as this type of constructive effort will have to take place by the state, due to the public nature of the investments. The trends we recognised were all centred around the idea that change was shifting towards increasing the quality of life for all residents of the area, without disturbing the environment as much as we currently do. For this reason, public transportation in particular was noted as a key change that would take place to allow commuters to move faster and cheaper around the area of holborn without needing to damage both the local and the global environment through noise and air pollution. Trams provide the perfect solution for this as they are easy to use, inexpensive and have greatly reduced output of emissions due to the only emissions being produced via producing electricity. Improving the livelihood of residents as well as commuters entails moving healthy amenities towards holborn, meaning people don’t have to leave the area to seek entertainment. For this reason we predict that dog friendly areas are more likely to be invested in (such as Lincolns inn field). Dogs provide both exercise and entertainment, and residents needing to go further out to get a more fulfilling dog walk would not be beneficial to their wellbeing; for this reason we would expect more dog friendly attractions to appear. Another effort to reduce our carbon footprint and boost the economy in the local area is to reduce food waste. This would mean less money would be wasted on food as people would eat more of what is produced. We believe new technologies such as a food tracking app would assist in this and while we know this isn’t exclusive to Holborn, the effect would certainly be noticeable here as there is often lots of rubbish containing lots of food lining the streets. </p>
