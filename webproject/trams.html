        Whilst tram networks already exist in south London, they currently don't exist in the city centre.
        With tram networks expanding across Europe due to environmental and economic sustainability, we predict their
        implementation into future central London including the Holborn neighbourhood, in line with the demand for
        transportation, especially for those who work in the area as Holborn as many offices are based in the area.

      <h2>What are trams?</h2>
      <p>Trams are public transportation services for urban city areas involving vehicles running on tracks on public 
        streets, and are powered by electricity collected by a pantograph from an overhead line.</p>
      <h2>Why may trams be implemented into central London?</h2>
      <p>According to Campaign for Better Transport, a single lane of a city street could carry 1,500 people per hour in cars, 
        8,000 people in buses, or up to 22,000 people if it was used as a tram way. Trams are known for punctuality since 
        running on dedicated tracks means they bypass traffic congestion, allowing for timetables to be kept reliable and 
        predictable. Trams travel at slower speeds in cities, providing safety for pedestrains and cyclists. Modern trams are 
        all electric, which helps to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In Holborn and St Pancras, transport is responsible for 14% of climate emissions, and causes air pollution, which is a significant risk to public health. Many trams feature full level-boarding, 
        adding accessibility to wheelchair users and users with pushchairs or luggage. Trams have a long lifespan, outlasting 
        buses and other rapid transit systems. Trams networks are cheaper and easier to install than rail lines. Trams are also 
        becoming increasingly popular over travel options like bus or bicycle.</p>
